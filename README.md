A flexible JavaScript widget that takes readings (direction, speed and timestamp) and turns them into a nice visualization.
Data can come from any source, the demo shows data from a public MQTT server and also includes a NodeJS server which listens to a NMEA0183
anemometer on a serial port to supply that data.
